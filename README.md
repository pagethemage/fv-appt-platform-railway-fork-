# fv-appt-platform

The FV Referees department would like to provide a better experience for referees when appointing to football matches by improving their semi-automatic process. Appointment requires matching location, experience, maturity, and appropriate age to the match. It also requires accuracy, timing, and flexibility. The main goal is to fix the issue of mass declines in age groups of U12, 13, and 14’s fixtures which can impact the growth of football in Victoria. Having this platform run with the below requirements will help to ensure higher acceptance of appointments. This platform is to compliment the current use of Schedula which is the Referees Appointment System that does not have a graphical visualization but stores the Club's and Referees' information and history.

## Build front-end

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:kyledenis/fv-appt-platform.git
    cd fv-appt-platform
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` to view the webapp in the browser.

> Keep terminal open to host front-end.

## Build back-end

1. In a separate terminal from the project's root directory, navigate to the `backend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    - On macOS and Linux:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Set up your database:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```

6. Create a superuser for admin access (optional):

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py runserver
    ```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

> Keep terminal open to host backend.
## Integrate Azure SQL database with Django

1. Remove old migration files in appointment_management/migrations (optional)

2. Install the required packages in your virtual environment
    ```
    pip install pyodbc
    ```
    ```
    pip install mssql-django
    ```

3. Save these packages in requirement.txt (optional)

    ```
    pip freeze > requirment.txt
    ```

4. Check if Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server is installed

    Window users:
    Open the ODBC Data Source Administrator tool. You can find it by searching for "ODBC" in the Start menu.
    In the ODBC Data Source Administrator window, go to the "Drivers" tab.
    Look for "ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server" or the specific version of the driver you installed.

    MacOS users:
    Run the command
    ```
    odbcinst -q -d -n
    ```
    If not installed, install via https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16

5. Navigate to the fv_backend/settings.py file and change the database settings to:

    ```
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'mssql',
            'NAME': 'AFL Victoria',
            'USER': 'aflvic',
            'PASSWORD': 'Nga123456@',
            'HOST': 'afl-victoria-sql.database.windows.net',
            'PORT': '1433',
            'OPTIONS': {
                'driver': 'ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server',
            },
        },
    }
    ```
6. Delete previous models in appointment_management/models.py

7. Migrate Azure database models to the app's model file

    ```
    python manage.py inspectdb > appointment_management/models.py
    ```

8. Check if database tables can be migrated 

    Create a python file (example.py) and type

    ```
    from appointment_management.models import Referee

    first_referee = Referee.objects.get(pk=1)

    print(first_referee)
    ```
    Run the file and check terminal output

    ```
    python example.py
    ```
> You can also check if you have access to Azure SQL database on Azure portal: https://portal.azure.com/#browse/Microsoft.Sql%2Fservers%2Fdatabases
